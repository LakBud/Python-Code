# Python Code Practice Archive

The project groups learning scripts and small exercises by topic so it is easy
to find material that matches a particular Python concept.

- `learning/` contains exploratory notebooks and experiments kept in their
  original, chronological folders.
- `tasks/` organises focused practice scripts by concept (data structures,
  iteration, input/output, GUI, etc.). See [`tasks/README.md`](tasks/README.md)
  for a breakdown of each directory.

The repository started as a chronological archive; the new layout keeps all of
that history while making the exercises easier to navigate.
