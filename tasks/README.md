# Task directory overview

The practice scripts are now grouped by the primary Python concept they
exercise:

- `data_structures/` – dictionaries, lists, and tuples.
- `gui/` – graphical interfaces built with Turtle or Tkinter.
- `io/` – console programs that focus on user input/output.
- `iteration/` – loop-based exercises, including multiplication tables and
  enumerations.
- `strings/` – formatting and string-manipulation snippets.

Each subdirectory contains small, focused scripts so you can quickly find the
example that matches the concept you want to revisit.
